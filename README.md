# Zoo

## Challenge
Create a zoo hierarchy class structure that uses all four principles of object-oriented programming. The requirements are as follows:
3 different abstract classes
3 layers of inheritance
5 concrete animals
2 abstract methods
2 abstract properties
2 virtual methods (override one of them)
2 virtual properties (override one of them)

## Object-Oriented Programming Principles
Abstraction - Break down into smaller components such as classes that are used to describe the characteristics of an object 
Polymorphism - This allows multiple methods to exist but with different functionality
Inheritance - This describes how objects can relate to each other and pass properties and functionality to derived classes. 
Encapsulation - This allows data to be restricted or permit access to everyone.
